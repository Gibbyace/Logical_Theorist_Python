Recreation of Logical Theorist (LT) in Python

I am starting with Theorem Proofs and Automated Theorem Provers, and I started with the Logical Theorist.
I read the original Paper of the Logical Theorist, and to test my understanding of the paper, I recreated it in Python. 
This is my quick first draft of it, the paper will be linked into this Repo.
